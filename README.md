# Autonomous-Car-in-Unity-using-ML-Agents
A project where I created a self driving car using Unity's ML-Agents plugin as 
part of Minor Project in 7th Semester in Bachelor's program.

Unfortuantely I can't upoad the project here due to its trmendous file count and size.
I'll put a Google Drive link to the project soon. Untill then I've the report my team made for
this project.
